Netflix_Dataset_Analysis

In this project, we'll delve into a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset, which includes TV shows and movies available on Netflix up to 2021. This dataset, sourced from Flixable and available on Kaggle, will be explored using various functions and commands to uncover valuable insights.

We'll start by importing the dataset into a Jupyter notebook using the Pandas library. The dataset, stored in CSV format, will be loaded into a DataFrame named 'data.' We will then use a variety of commands to examine and manipulate the data, including:

Data Inspection: Using functions such as head(), tail(), shape, and size to understand the dataset's structure and content.

Data Cleaning: Employing dropna() and duplicated() to handle null values and duplicates.

Data Exploration: Utilizing info(), value_counts(), unique(), and nunique() to gather insights about data distribution and uniqueness.

Data Transformation: Creating new columns and DataFrames, and applying functions like str.contains(), str.split(), and to_datetime() for enhanced data analysis.

Data Visualization: Generating bar graphs using Seaborn to visualize trends and distributions.
